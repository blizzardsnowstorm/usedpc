A simple python game about someone who finds a used PC.
it WILL be shitty.
mainly text based, within the terminal.
uhhh idk how this all works, just make sure you have the packages within a venv
and run the file. Look man, i'm a dumbass. For me it's "python3 usedpc.py".
uhhh dont look at the code please for the love of god

thank you
